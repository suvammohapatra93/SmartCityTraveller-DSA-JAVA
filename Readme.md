# Suvam's Smart City Traveller ðŸš—ðŸŒ†

Smart City Traveller is a Java-based project that simulates navigation and optimization within a city's road network. The project utilizes core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts like Graph representation, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to provide efficient routing and road optimization. This project doesn't rely on any backend services or external libraries and focuses purely on algorithmic implementations.

# Features ðŸ“‹

Graph Representation of a City: Locations and roads between them are represented as a weighted undirected graph.
Shortest Path Calculation: Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between any two locations.
Minimum Spanning Tree Calculation: Uses Kruskal's algorithm to optimize the road network, ensuring the minimum cost to connect all locations.
Efficient Data Structures: Implements adjacency lists, priority queues, and disjoint sets for efficient graph operations.

# Algorithms Used ðŸš€

1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
   Why it is used: Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is used to compute the shortest paths between a source location and all other locations in the city. It ensures that each road's weight (distance or traffic) is minimized when calculating the optimal route.
   What it does: It maintains a priority queue (min-heap) to iteratively explore the nearest unvisited location, relaxing the edges as needed to find the shortest path to all other locations.
   Key Concept: Greedy approach to find the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

- Time Complexity: O((V + E) \* log(V)), where V is the number of vertices (locations) and E is the number of edges (roads).

2. Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithm
   Why it is used: Kruskalâ€™s algorithm is used to compute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the city's road network, which optimizes the total cost to connect all locations while minimizing the total weight of the roads.
   What it does: It sorts all the roads (edges) by weight and uses a disjoint-set (union-find) data structure to add the smallest road to the MST, as long as it doesnâ€™t form a cycle.
   Key Concept: Greedy approach to ensure that the total weight of roads is minimized while maintaining full connectivity between locations.

- Time Complexity: O(E \* log(V)), where V is the number of vertices (locations) and E is the number of edges (roads).
